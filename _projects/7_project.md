For this course assignment, I and a partner worked together to implement a search algorithm that planned an optimal sequence of moves for a player of a strategy game [End of the Track](https://www.gaya-game.com/products/the-end-of-the-track). For the assignment, we implemented an A* search based algorithm based on a custom heuristic.

(I won't share the code/implementation details publicly for purposes of academic integrity)
