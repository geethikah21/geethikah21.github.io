For this course assignment, I implemented a hand gesture detection system. There were 10 different gesture classes, some of which were very similar (e.g., one class was a fist facing the camera and another was a fist facing in a different orientation). I was provided a dataset of images with various hand gestures and their corresponding labels.

This was an open-ended assignment: I was free to implement the full pipeline (data loading, feature extraction, training, and evaluation) as I saw fit.

(I won't share the code/implementation details publicly for purposes of academic integrity)
