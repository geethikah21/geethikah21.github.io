For my Human Sensing and Signals course project, I wanted to design a prototype for an application that would monitor a person's hydration levels based on their water intake and physical activity. Towards this goal, I collected data for and trained two models: a drinking gesture detection model and activity recognition model.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/hydration_hw_diagram.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

Here are the slides for the in-class presentation I gave:

Here is the full report:
