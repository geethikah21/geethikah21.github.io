Hello! I am a **MS Robotics** student at **Carnegie Mellon University**. I previously graduated with a **BS and MS in Computer Science** from **The University of Texas at Austin**. I also worked full-time at **Goldman Sachs** for a year.

Previously, I worked with Dr. Justin Hart on research within social navigation and human-robot interaction. I also worked with Dr. Peter Stone as part of the UT Austin Villa/[WisTex United](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/news/2024/robot-soccer-and-more-ut-students-best-competition-eindhoven) RoboCup [Standard Platform League](https://spl.robocup.org/) teams.

I am broadly interested in **robot perception**, especially multimodal perception, and **robot learning**. My long-term goal/vision is to enable robots to be able to robustly perceive and act in dynamic, real-world environments.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and learning the guitar, watching sports such as soccer and football, cooking/baking, and doing puzzles.

I am always receptive to learning from anyone about anything!
